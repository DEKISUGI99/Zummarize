The struct node is something like this where you store the value 5. It has a pointer, a left pointer and a right pointer. The left pointer will be pointing to the left children which is 6. A tree is basically represented and a C++ using pointers. Now how can you represent them in a code? Let's check that out. So basically this was the stuff that we were using. So this data will be nothing but this guy. So basically I've created this guy. So I'll assign that to data. One root is created. Next I'm saying root collect this guy's left. So basically I'm assigning this guy’s left. Okay and I’m saying new node again I'm creating one more node. New node of five. So in this way I can create this tree and if you want to create a bigger tree you can definitely use are these kind of syntaxes. So this is how you will represent a binary in C++. With this let's wrap up this video. Let's meet in the next lecture. ther series. Also if you're new to the channel please do consider subscribing because I'm going to bring in such more series in the upcoming future.
